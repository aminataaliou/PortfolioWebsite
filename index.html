            <p>
                I’m a 19-year-old student at the University of Ottawa, currently in my third year of studying 
                Mechanical Engineering and Computer Technology. I’ve always been passionate about understanding how things work 
                and finding creative ways to solve problems, whether it’s designing a project from scratch or figuring out the 
                best approach to a challenging equation.
            </p>
            <p>
                What truly excites me is the process of turning ideas into reality. Whether I’m working on a SolidWorks model, 
                coding a program, or analyzing systems, I find joy in combining technical skills with curiosity and determination. 
                Beyond academics, I’m someone who loves to explore innovation and sustainability, always seeking ways to make a 
                positive impact through my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not studying or creating, you might find me learning new tools, collaborating with teammates, or tackling 
                hands-on projects that push my skills further. To me, engineering isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about 
                building a better, smarter future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to learn about me! I look forward to sharing my journey and connecting with others 
                who are as passionate about technology and design as I am.
            </p>
